### Submission Track
> `Full Game`

### Project Summary
> Blockroooma is a first person backrooms inspired 3d shooter game that brings the spookiness of the void onchain! While others got it easy, you are trapped by some mysterious folks who tie you down on to  a wall and left to feed you to those lost sulds. Fight against randomly spawning entities and decide which one of them is even real? Survive to try even more harder levels to escape the infinite enclosures.
